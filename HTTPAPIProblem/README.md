# Model and handle HTTP API Problems (RFC 9457)

This example application showcase one possible way to model and handle HTTP API Problems,
as defined by [RFC 9457](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9457/).

The idea of an OpaqueValue is also touched upon. Stolen from [Representing arbitrary data (e.g JSON) as a custom and opaque Codable type](https://medium.com/@thomsmed/representing-arbitrary-data-e-g-json-as-a-custom-and-opaque-codable-type-dfaa07b22cd3).
